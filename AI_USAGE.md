# AI Usage Documentation

This document outlines how AI-assisted tools were utilized during the development of the Reviews Management System and identifies areas where human effort played the central role.

## Tools Used

- **Codeium**: Used for generating boilerplate code, autocomplete suggestions, and providing quick syntax help.
- **ChatGPT**: Used to clarify design patterns, architectural decisions, and debugging strategies.

## Areas Where AI Was Used

1. **Project Setup:**
    - Generating initial configurations for tools like ESLint, Prettier, and TypeScript.
    - Providing template files for README.md, LICENSE, and CONTRIBUTING.md.

2. **Code Scaffolding:**
    - Creating foundational components (e.g., UI components, API routes) and sample CRUD operations.
    - Suggesting TypeScript interfaces and typing for various entities like `Review`.
    - Proposing algorithms for review scoring and filtering logic.

3. **Debugging:**
    - Analyzing error messages and suggesting fixes for performance issues in the backend.

4. **Documentation:**
    - Structuring this `AI_USAGE.md` file and other documentation (e.g., comments and inline docstrings).

## Areas Where My Effort Was Primary

1. **System Architecture:**
    - Deciding the overall architecture.
    - Designing the module structure and API contracts.

2. **Implementation of Core Logic:**
    - Writing the business logic for managing reviews.
    - Implementing security measures such as data validation.

3. **Performance Optimization:**
    - Profiling the system for bottlenecks and fine-tuning queries, caching, and middleware logic.

4. **Testing:**
    - Designing and implementing unit tests, integration tests, and end-to-end tests to validate system correctness.

5. **UI/UX Decisions:**
    - Customizing UI components to match the desired look and feel.
    - Designing user flows and ensuring accessibility compliance.
